SDLC
======
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT Industries to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

We have six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence


1) Feasibility study 
---------------------
Feasibility study completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical feasibility
	E - Economical feasbility 
	L - Legal feasibility
	O - Operational feasibility
	S - Scheduled feasibility 

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Design Document.



2) Analysis 
-----------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirement and software requirements.

Later they will keep all the above information in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirements Specification.



3) Designing 
------------
We have two types of designing.

1) High Level designing 
----------------------
A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

In high level designing, we will design main/major modules.


2) Low Level designing 
------------------------
A team lead/project lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

In low level designing , we will design child/sub modules.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

PDD stands for Product Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.

4) Coding
----------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build.

Developers even responsible to perform unit testing.


5) Testing 
----------
In testing phase, Testing team or QA team will involved.

They will use one software component called STLC to test the build.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
-----------------------------
Before delivery , we will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

UAT testing is divided into two types.

i) Alpha testing 

ii) Beta testing
