Q) Write a java program to display array elements in spiral form?

input:
	1 2 3
	4 5 6
	7 8 9 

output:
	1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5 

ex:
---
class Test  
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int[][] matrix={
						{1,2,3},
						{4,5,6},
						{7,8,9}
					};
		int rows=matrix.length;
		int cols=matrix[0].length;
		
		int left=0;
		int right=rows-1;
		int top=0;
		int bottom=cols-1;
		
		while(true)
		{
			if(left>right)
			{
				break;
			}
			for(int i=left;i<=right;i++)
			{
				System.out.print(matrix[top][i]+" ");
			}                                
			top++;	
			
			if(top>bottom)
			{
				break;
			}
			for(int i=top;i<=bottom;i++)
			{
				System.out.print(matrix[i][right]+" ");
			}                             
			right--;     
			
			
			if(left>right)
			{
				break;
			}
			for(int i=right;i>=left;i--)
			{
				System.out.print(matrix[bottom][i]+" ");
			}                                                    
			bottom--;	
			
			if(top>bottom)
			{
				break;
			}
			for(int i=bottom;i>=top;i--)
			{
				System.out.print(matrix[i][left]+" ");
			}                                  
			left++;  
		}										 
		
		
	}
}

OOPS
=====
OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System / Structure.

OOPS allows us to deal with real world entities using programming language.

A language is said to be object oriented if it supports following features.

ex:
	class
	object 
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	and 
	Polymorphism


class
======
A class is a blue print of an object.

A class is a collection of objects.

We can declare a class as follow.

syntax:
	optional
	   |
	 Modifier  class  class_name <extends> Parent_classname
				     <implements> interface_name 
	{
		-
		- 
		- 
	}

A class will accept following modifiers.

ex:
	default
	public
	final
	abstract 


Realtime example
-----------------
To constructor a building we required a design. That design is known as blue print/class.



Q) What is difference between default class and public class?

default class					public class
--------------------				-----------------
If we declare a class without modifier 		If we declare a class with public modifier
is called default class.			is called public class.

ex:						ex:
	class Test					public class Test
	{						{
		
	}						}

If we declare any class as default then 	If we declare any class as public then
we can access that class within the package.	we can access that class within the package
						and outside the package.


Q) What is the difference between final class and abstract class?

final class					abstract class
-------------					-----------------
If we declare a class with final modifier	If we declare a class with abstract modifier
is called final class. 				is called abstract class.

ex:						ex:
	final class Test				abstract class Test 
	{						{

	}						}

Child creation is not possible.			Child creation is possible.

We can create object.				We can't create object.
