History of Java
================
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box. That time project was called Stealth project and later it was renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System. James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project. But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we created our own programming language which is system independent. 

In 1991, They have develop a programming language called OAK. OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany, France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java. Java is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project, they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence a symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Identifiers
===========
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be class name, variable name, method name or label name.

ex:
	class  Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int x=10;

			System.out.println(x); 
		}
	}
	
	Here Test, main , args , x , String, System are identifiers.


Rules to declare an identifiers
--------------------------------
Rule1:
-----
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
-----
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp$alary;
		int  emp_id;
		int  emp#Name; //invalid 

Rule3:
-----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet, dollar or underscore but not with digit.
	ex:
		int  emp123;
		int  _empSal;
		int  $alary;		
		int  1abcd; // invalid 

Rule4:
-----
	We can't take reserved words as an identifiers.
	ex:
		int  if;  //invalid 
		int  else; //invalid 
		int   for; //invalid 

Rule5:
------
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int  number;
		int  NUMBER;
		int  NuMbEr; 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it not recommanded to take more then 
	15 characters.



Reserved Words
===============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning 
such type of identifiers are called reserved words. 

Java supports 53 reserved words.

All reserved words we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

In java , reserved words are divided into two types.
